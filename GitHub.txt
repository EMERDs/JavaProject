Version Control / Code Repository:-

1. Code management.  
	1.1. branching.
	1.2. merging.
	1.3. Proper restrictions on code.
2. User can able to perfrom below operations.
	2.1. check-out.
	2.2. check-in.

we can able to perfrom anything under any user. without any account on GitHub we can't perfrom anything.

Code management:
	1. Direct User level.
	2. Organization.

	
	1. git clone --> A local repo created which alaways sync to remote repo.
	
		ex: git clone https://github.com/rajameka/JavaProject.git
